Jms2Rest
========

Shows how to write an adapter from the Event driven world to the REST world.

The idea is to have a REST Service for persons that is available on HTTP.
We now want to also receive updates from a JMS queue. So camel is used to implement an adapter from
JMS events to REST calls.

The route personJms2rest does the following steps:
- Receive an person XML document on a queue
- Extract the person id from the XML document and store it into a Header
- Build the REST URL using a fixed part and the person id header
- Call the REST Service with the XML Payload

To make testing easier there is a second route "file2jms" that listens to a folder "in" below the karaf directory and sends a message for each file
you put in there. 

Prerequisites
-------------

As the example needs a rest service to call you need to install the server part of the personservice example into karaf first.

Build
-----

Go to the example project directory and type

> mvn clean install

Prepare karaf for snapshots
---------------------------

Add the line below to org.ops4j.pax.url.cfg below repo1
http://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-group@snapshots@noreleases@id=apache, \

This directs karaf to also look for bundles in the apache snapshot repository.

Install personservice
---------------------

feature:repo-add cxf 3.1.5
feature:install cxf-jaxrs http

install -s mvn:net.lr.tutorial.karaf.cxf.personrest/personrest-model/1.0-SNAPSHOT
install -s mvn:net.lr.tutorial.karaf.cxf.personrest/personrest-server/1.0-SNAPSHOT
install -s mvn:net.lr.tutorial.karaf.cxf.personrest/personrest-webui/1.0-SNAPSHOT

Install jms2rest
----------------

feature:repo-add activemq 5.12.2
feature:repo-add camel 2.16.2
feature:install  camel-blueprint camel-jms camel-http camel-saxon activemq-broker jms
jms:create -t activemq localhost
install -s mvn:net.lr.tutorial.karaf.camel/example-jms2rest/1.0-SNAPSHOT

What did we install
-------------------

We first added the feature files for camel and activemq.
Then we installed the necessary features for a local ActiveMQ broker and our example.

The create broker command creates a blueprint xml file in the deploy folder that starts and configures a broker. It also initializes a
PoolingConnectionFactory as an OSGi service that we need for our example.

As a last step we install the example project. The example also starts with a blueprint context that loads camel and the Jms2RestRoute RouteBuilder.

Test
----

Run in karaf to see what happens:
log:tail

To test the route we simply copy the file src/test/resources/person1.xml into the "in" folder below that karaf directory. This file will first be sent to the 
jms queue "person". There the second route picks up the message, transforms it into the rest call and calls the rest service.

If the rest service is not installed you will see a 404 http error in the karaf log (log:display).

If the rest service is installed it should print "update request received".
You should also see the messages CXF receives and sends back.
