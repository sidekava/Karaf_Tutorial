## Installation

Download and start karaf >= 4.1. If you want to use karaf 4.0.x you need to switch the way the http servlet is published. See the comment in TaskListServlet.

	feature:repo-add mvn:net.lr.tasklist/tasklist-features/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml
	feature:install example-tasklist

# Test

	http:list

This should show the servlet we expose.

	task:list
	
Will list the tasks currently managed by the service

Open the URL below in your browser [http://localhost:8181/tasklist](http://localhost:8181/tasklist). It should show the pre defined tasks.
